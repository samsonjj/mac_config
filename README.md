## Settings
. hide the dock
. minimize the size of the dock
. had to rename my user, using guide (here)[https://support.apple.com/en-us/102547]

## Software

. Install Docker
. Install dev-tools (type git in terminal, and a prompt should come up)
. Install Rectangle (tile manager)
. Install ohmyzsh (batteries included zsh configuration & config manager)
. Create and add github personal access token
